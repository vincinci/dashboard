## 🌐 Deployment Options

### Recommended: Railway
1. Connect GitHub repository
2. Create backend service with environment variables
3. Create frontend service with API URL
4. Automatic deployments on push

### Alternative: Vercel + Railway
1. Backend on Railway
2. Frontend on Vercel
3. Environment variables configured

### Self-hosted: VPS/DigitalOcean
1. PM2 for process management
2. Nginx for reverse proxy
3. SSL certificates
4. Database backup strategy

## 🔧 Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- [ ] Monitor application logs
- [ ] Update dependencies monthly
- [ ] Database backups
- [ ] SSL certificate renewal
- [ ] Performance monitoring

### Scaling Considerations
- [ ] Database connection pooling
- [ ] CDN for static assets
- [ ] Load balancing for multiple instances
- [ ] Caching layer (Redis)
- [ ] Image storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary)

## 📞 Support & Documentation
