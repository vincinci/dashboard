# Logo Setup Instructions

## Add Your Logo

To complete the logo setup:

1. **Save your logo image** as `logo.png` in this folder (`frontend/public/`)
2. **Replace the placeholder file** that's currently there
3. **Recommended specifications:**
   - Format: PNG (with transparent background preferred)
   - Dimensions: 200x60 pixels (or similar 3.3:1 aspect ratio)
   - File name: `logo.png` (exact name)

## Your Logo

The logo should be the "store IWANYU" logo with:
- Shopping bag icon on the left
- ".store" in red text
- "IWANYU" in black text

## Fallback

If the logo file is not found, the application will automatically show a text fallback with the same styling.

## File Path
